| < title >    | This shows a title for the web application; This will appear in the browsers title bar. |
| < body >    | This is a container of everything that is in the body of the web app, most everything will be located within. |
| < h1 >    | Defines a large header, works very similar to # in markdown. The higher the number, the smaller the text will appear. |
| < p >    | Defines a simple paragraph tag. |
